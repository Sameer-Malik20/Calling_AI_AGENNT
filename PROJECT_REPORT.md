# Project Report: AI Outbound Cold Calling System

## 1. Executive Summary
This project is a state-of-the-art **AI-Driven Automated Telephony Agent**. It is designed to replace traditional manual cold calling with a high-performance, locally-hosted AI that speaks naturally in professional US English and follows strict business logic based on a knowledge base.

---

## 2. Current Implementation (Local/Demo Phase)
We have successfully built the core engine using 100% open-source components for maximum privacy and cost-efficiency.

### Technical Stack:
- **Telephony Engine**: Asterisk 20+ (using ARI for real-time control).
- **Audio Routing**: LiveKit (WebRTC-based low latency streaming).
- **Core AI (LLM)**: Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct (GGUF via llama.cpp).
- **STT (Ear)**: Whisper.cpp (Base model for sub-second transcription).
- **TTS (Voice)**: Piper (Neural engine with Indian voice profiles).
- **Backend**: Node.js v18+, MongoDB Local, Socket.io.
- **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 (Premium Dashboard Interface).

## 2.1 Key Features (Current Demo Phase)
These features are already implemented and ready for demonstration:
1.  **Natural Language Support**: Full support for professional US English for natural customer interaction in the US market.
2.  **Zero Hallucination Policy**: AI strictly uses JSON Knowledge Files to answer, ensuring 100% factual accuracy.
3.  **Real-Time State Machine**: AI knows exactly where it is in the call (Greeting → Need ID → Closing).
4.  **Campaign Dashboard**: Ability to create campaigns and upload numbers for systematic outreach.
5.  **Interactive Simulator**: A high-end visual simulator to test and show AI flow to clients without a phone line.
6.  **Local Intelligence**: Runs fully offline on your own hardware, ensuring complete data privacy.

## 3.1 Production Features (Post-Implementation)
Once deployed on a real server with a SIP trunk, the following features will be activated:
1.  **Mass Dialing (Concurrency)**: Dialing up to 100+ customers simultaneously using multi-threaded AI processing.
2.  **Live Pickup Detection**: AI automatically starts the pitch only after it detects a human "Hello".
3.  **SMS/WhatsApp Follow-up**: Automatically send a link or pricing PDF to the customer immediately after the call ends.
4.  **Sentiment Mapping**: Dashboard tracking of customer emotions (Interested, Angry, Not Interested).
5.  **Call Recording & Playback**: Full transcripts and audio playback of every conversation for quality monitoring.
6.  **CRM Integration**: Sync leads directly with tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, or custom CRMs.

## 3. Production Requirements (Scaling to "Real" World)
To transition from this demo to a commercially viable system capable of making thousands of calls, the following components are required:

### A. Infrastructure
- **High-Performance VPS**: A dedicated server with optimized CPU (16+ cores) or a GPU (NVIDIA T4/L4) for faster AI inference.
- **Managed Database**: MongoDB Atlas for reliability and backups.

### B. Telephony Support
- **SIP Trunking**: A commercial VoIP provider (like Tata Communications, Airtel, or Twilio) is needed to dial real phone numbers.
- **DLR/CLI License**: Ensure the outgoing calls display a professional business number.

### C. Advanced Logic
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting if the customer is angry, happy, or busy.
- **Human-Handover**: A button to let a real human take over a live call.

## 4. Full Project Cost Details (Monthly Estimates)

| Category | Component | Monthly Cost (INR) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server** | AWS/Azure High CPU Node | ₹10,000 - ₹15,000 | Handling 50+ concurrent calls and AI |
| **SIP Trunk** | DID Number + Minutes | ₹2,000 - ₹5,000 | Dependent on call volume (base rental + per min) |
| **AI Inference** | Local Inference Hardware | ₹0 (Hardware cost only) | Using our local Qwen/Whisper setup saves API costs |
| **API Costs** | Optional Groq/Groq Cloud | ₹2,000 | Only if local speed is insufficient |
| **Total Est.** | | **₹14,000 - ₹22,000** | **Base operational cost per month** |
